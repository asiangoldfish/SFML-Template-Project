# SFML-Template-Project

Create a new SFML project template for Visual Studio.

# Instructions
To create a new project:
1. Run the following command in a Linux/WSL environment:
```
./sfml_newProject.sh .
```
You can replace `.` with the target directory's path.

# How it works
The archive file _sfml_template.tar.gz_ contains a Visual Studio solution, and a copy of SFML binaries and include files. To open the new project in Visual Studio, simply open the File Explorer and double click on the solution file.
